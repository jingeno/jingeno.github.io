# GitHub Pages Sample ([jingeno.github.io](https://jingeno.github.io/))

[GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) is a static site hosting service provided by [GitHub](https://github.com/). It takes HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files from a GitHub repository (it can also optionally run them through a build process) and then publishes a website.

Websites published through GitHub Pages can be hosted on the `github.io` domain or you can use your own custom domain.

This repository is a simple example of a website that is hosted on GitHub Pages. It can be viewed live at [jingeno.github.io](https://jingeno.github.io/).
